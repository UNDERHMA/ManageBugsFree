        <p class="homepage"><strong>ManageBugsFree</strong> is a bug tracking application. There are two 
                    distinct roles available for users; "Software Developer" and 
                    "Customer Support Representative." Each role comes with a few distinct views and permissions. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="homepage"><strong>Customer Support Representatives (CSRs)</strong> can submit 
                    <strong>Local Bug Tracker</strong> reports <strong>(LBTs)</strong> when they encounter or are informed of 
                    a software issue. <strong>Software Developers</strong> can then review Unlinked LBT reports
                    and then open <strong>Bug Reports (BRs)</strong> to resolve the reported issue. The CSR or 
                    Software Developer can then link the LBT report to the Bug report, which allows 
                    both parties to better track the origin and resolution of the issue.
